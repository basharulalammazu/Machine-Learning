## 📖 Overview

This **Feature Extraction & CNN Features Extraction** system uses both traditional machine learning techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract useful features from image datasets. These features are used for classification tasks like image recognition and object detection.

## 💡 Features
- **Traditional Feature Extraction**: Utilizes techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to extract features.
- **CNN Features Extraction**: Leverages pre-trained CNN models (such as VGG16 and ResNet) to extract high-level features.
- **Feature Fusion**: Combines traditional and CNN-based features to improve model performance.
- **Efficient Image Processing**: Optimizes feature extraction to enhance the accuracy of downstream classification models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for implementation
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and using CNN models
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations and image data
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: For traditional feature extraction and machine learning models

## 🗂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of images from various categories, which are processed and used for feature extraction.
- **Relevant features used**:
  - **Traditional Features**: HOG, LBP
  - **CNN Features**: Extracted using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are loaded, resized, and normalized for both traditional and CNN-based feature extraction.
   
2. **Traditional Feature Extraction**: Techniques like HOG and LBP are applied to extract low-level features from images.
   
3. **CNN Feature Extraction**: Pre-trained CNN models are used to extract high-level features from images, capturing complex patterns and structures.
   
4. **Feature Fusion**: The extracted features from both methods are combined to create a richer feature set for classification tasks.

5. **Classification**: These features can be used in various machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) for image classification.
